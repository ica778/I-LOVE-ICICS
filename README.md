# I-LOVE-ICICS

Project Description:
The project will be a language learning application that allows users who are new to the language to search up phrases or words and find examples of how they're used. Whenever we learn a new language, most tools only teach new learners about basic sentence structure and vocabulary however, as language learners ourselves, we found that some problems that we often run into are the coloquialisms, slang, and uses of words or phrases in special circumstances that aren't normally taught by instructors or courses. As such, our aim is to develop a tool for users to both contribute and reap the benefits of being apart of a language learning community to learn the ins and outs that are commonly only known to native speakers. Through our web application, users will be able to search and filter words and phrases and have our search algorithm return not only matching results but also results in other tenses. Additionally, we included the ability for users to have our algorithm fill in blanks with nouns, verbs, and adjectives based on the users needs. Our end product will include a table with instructions on how to efficiently use the filters included with our search algorithm.
