# I-LOVE-ICICS

Project Description:
The project will be a shopping list that will work in a similar way to pcpartpicker.com. Users will make an account which is where their shopping list information will be stored. They can create one or more “shopping lists” and assign it a name to identify them. To add items to a shopping list they copy and paste a link (ex an amazon link) from a supported website with the item they want and the program creates an item in their current shopping list with information parsed from the website. They will be able to refer to their shopping lists and the items in their lists later when they log onto their account. Additionally functionality such as price matching from different websites or price charts may be added based on time constraints.
